# Content-based Filtering Recommendation System for Vkusotiiki-bg

## Description
Me and my teammates implemented some machine learning algorithms that are used as Content-based Filtering Recommendation System for our previous project called [Vkusotiiki-bg](https://github.com/kakato10/vkusotiiki-bg)

## Machine learning algorithms
The project implements the following machine learning algorithms in Python 3.5:

 - kNN (k Nearest Neighbours) with:
   - KD-Tree
   - Cosine similarity
   - Euclidean distance

 - Naive Bayes

 - k-Means

 - TF-IDF + Vector Space Model (Cosine similarity)
 

#### Installation details:
 - Install packages from requirements.txt in virtualenv

 - For Ubuntu: install also:

 ```sh
 sudo apt-get install python3-tk
 ```
